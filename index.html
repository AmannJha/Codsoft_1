                    <p>Brought from Persia to India by the Mughals, biryani is a classic Indian dish.

                        Rice and meat or vegetables are prepared separately, then combined and slow-cooked in the oven
                        to create this aromatic “dry dish” (there’s no creamy gravy-like sauce).</p>

                    <p>Butter chicken (or murgh makhani) is one of the most popular Indian curries.

                        Typically a mild curry, it combines onions, butter and cream in a velvety smooth tomato sauce
                        with chicken chunks.</p>

                    <p>Originating in the north of India, chaat is an Indian street-food snack. The word “chaat” means
                        “to lick” – and chaat is finger-licking delicious.

                        There are many types of chaat, but all have a starch base (like a samosa or puffed rice),
                        vegetables and chutney.

                        One of the most popular is papri chaat.</p>

                    <p>A thin pancake, dosa is crepe-like and slightly sweeter than naan (#9 below). Coming from the
                        southern part of India, it’s usually made from rice and lentils.

                        You usually eat dosas hot, dipped in various chutneys, as an accompaniment to a curry meal.</p>

                        Enter gulab jamun.

                        This popular Indian dessert is based on two flavors – gulab (which means rose) and jamun (which
                        refers to purple jamun berries, similar to blueberries).</p>

                    <p>Korma is another one of the best Indian dishes to hail from northern India.

                        Braised meat (maybe chicken or beef) and vegetables are slow cooked in a thick mild curry sauce
                        made with cream, coconut milk or yogurt and sometimes almonds.

                        It’s delicately spiced with coriander, saffron, ginger, cardamom and black peppercorn.</p>
